# Usage: process.sh [replication_dir] [split_dir] [changeset_dir] [bucket_dir] [api_url] [minutes_filter]
# 
# Does the following:
# - splits all adiffs in stage-data/replication-adiffs/*.adiff into stage-data/split-adiffs/*/
# - moves
# - merges all split adiffs in each split-adiffs/*/ into one merged-adiffs/*.adiff

# NOTE: this is an implementation detail of how OSMCha's deployment of these scripts
# works (the scripts are installed into /mnt/osmcha/bin). In your own deployment you
# should ensure that the scripts (specifically split_adiff.py, merge_adiff.py, and
# merge.mk) are in your $PATH, because process.sh assumes they are.

# export PATH=$PATH:/mnt/osmcha/bin # Is this really necesary, seems not
