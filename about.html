<p>
This is a web service providing <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Augmented_Diffs">
augmented diffs</a> for <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a> <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Changeset">changesets</a>.
An <i>augmented diff</i> is an XML file that describes the edits performed in a particular changeset.
Unlike the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmChange">osmChange</a> format used by the
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6">openstreetmap.org API</a>, augmented diffs
contain both the old and new versions of modified elements, and are augmented (hence the name) with
additional context about related elements, like parent ways of modified nodes or members of modified relations.
</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>Changeset-aligned adiffs are found at
<b><code>https://adiffs.osmcha.org/changesets/&lt;CHANGESET_ID&gt;.adiff</code></b>. For example:
<a href="https://adiffs.osmcha.org/changesets/160415129.adiff">https://adiffs.osmcha.org/changesets/160415129.adiff</a>. Changeset-aligned adiffs contain the complete
set of changes for a specific changeset, and are useful for visualizing or analyzing a given
changeset.</p>
<p>Replication-aligned adiffs are also available at
<b><code>https://adiffs.osmcha.org/replication/minute/&lt;SEQNO&gt;.adiff</code></b>. For example:
<a href="https://adiffs.osmcha.org/replication/minute/6429815.adiff">https://adiffs.osmcha.org/replication/minute/6429815.adiff</a> (which corresponds to
<a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute/006/449/815.osc.gz">https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute/006/449/815.osc.gz</a>). Replication-aligned adiffs
contain changes from many different changesets which occurred during the same minute, and may not
contain complete changesets, so they are likely to only be useful for specialized purposes.</p>
