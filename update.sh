# Usage: update.sh planet.osmx data-directory
#
# Updates planet.osmx with the latest OSM changes from the replication server,
# and generates augmented diffs and places them in the data-directory.
#
# This script runs once and then exits. How long it takes to run depends on
# how far behind planet.osmx is compared to the latest available seqno on the
# replication server. To keep your planet.osmx continuously up to date, you
# should run this script in a cron job once per minute. It is good practice
# to use flock to ensure that only one instance of the job is running at a time.
